# Freeloader

Freeloader is a JavaScript framework for server-rendered web apps.

Freeloader is two things:

1. Declarative behavior for DOM elements.
2. Fast XHR-based page reloading.

Freeloader is intended for a CJS environment such as Browserify.

Install:

```
$ npm install freeloader-js
```

More documentation coming soon.
